First Day : 18 Dec 2016
    We were so excited that day to start with our very first project given by citi. We were suppose to make Reccommendation System based on market cap.*so confused* We spend an hour on discussing from where we gonna to start:D After having some discussion we started by visiting the sites which are provided by citi. As suggested by our mentors we had started with drawing ER-Diagram and flow chart of our program.We were like totally dependant on our mentor.We are making the diagram and sending the pic to our mentor.and then eagerly waiting for the reply from him. This is what we were acheived by spending an entire sunday on it.At the end of the day we have our flow chart ready with us.
    After coming to room we had started watching and learning tutorials on youtube and google.
Firstly,we tried to get all the stuffs in one go .We also thought of coding on the First day itself .Yeah,I know it was funny.Then we messaged our mentor,about what we should do today. So our both mentors advised us to draw the ER-Diagram and try to understand the flow of the project.They also told us to go through the Angularjs tutorials.So, we read the tutorials.And some people were thinking about the strategies for the bussiness logic.We also read and studies more about the basics of marrket cap and stock selection factors.
And then finally sitting for 4 hrs,as it was Sunday evening,we all went to our respective rooms and decided to meet next thursday.
